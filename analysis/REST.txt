IDEA:
	User create CalendarTemplates, not PhotoCalendars.
	Other users may take and tailor the templates to their needs and instantiate them.
	Those are called TailoredCalendars. TailoredCalendars are always private,
	whereas Templates may be public or whatever.
	Tailored attributes are:
		Starting date of the calendar
		type of the calendar-view.
	Both attributs can be set as default values in the templates.

Things that need to be stored.
	User:
		identifier: number
		account: gmailAccount (Email address)
		name: String
		defaulCalendar: TailoredCalendar
		viewType: Daily | Weekly | Monthly - 
		OPTIONAL:
			myCalendars: List of TailoredCalendar
			favoriteCalendars: List of CalendarTemplate
		
	PhotoCalendar: (kind of abstract base class.. ;) )
		name: String
		description: Text
		pictures: list of Urls
		
		CalendarTemplate: (as kind of enrichment of PhotoCalendar)
			identifier: number
			creator: String - username
			type: Daily | Weekly | Monthly
			startDate: Date - so that we can compute which picture is to be shown
			OPTIONAL:
				visibility: private < friends < public
				likes : int
				dislikes : int

		TailoredCalendar: (as kind of enrichment of PhotoCalendar)
			identifier: number
			type: Daily | Weekly | Monthly
			startDate: Date
